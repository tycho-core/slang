I guess the fact that the bitwise assignments aren't used was what threw me off...<br><br>The distinction between <span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,Monospace">T_TYPE_ID</span> and <span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,Monospace">T_NON_TYPE_ID</span> then is not lexical, but semantic. That certainly  explains why I couldn't figure out how to define them in the tokenizer - because I can't, or at least wouldn't know how to do that in Coco/R.<br><br>A few minor modifications later my parser works like a charm!<br><br>Cheers, stephan<br>206494:6082330http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=606195&SiteID=1&pageid=0#6082332006-08-04T00:26:02ZRoss Ridge2006-08-04T00:26:02Zhttp://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=606195&SiteID=1&pageid=0#607810<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, Monospace">T_TYPE_ID</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, Monospace">T_NON_TYPE_ID</font> tokens are like identifiers in C.  The first is for identifiers that are types in scope created by <font face="Courier New, Courier, Monospace">typedef</font> and the second is for any other identifier.  So something like "<font face="Courier New, Courier, Monospace">typedef int foo; foo bar</font>" would tokenize as "<font face="Courier New, Courier, Monospace">T_KW_TYPEDEF T_KW_INT T_NON_TYPE_ID ';' T_TYPE_ID T_NON_TYPE_ID</font>".</p> <p>As for the assignment operators, the names are aribitrary so you should just make up your own if they're confusing.  I don't see any compatibility issue. The bitwise assigment operator tokens aren't used in the grammar, but should be treated as one erroneous token instead of two or three in case it matters somehow.</p>206494:6078101http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=606195&SiteID=1&pageid=0#6078102006-08-03T14:52:38Zstep2006-08-03T14:52:38Zhttp://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=606195&SiteID=1&pageid=0#606195Hi,<br><br>I am currently working on a HLSL parser, and while the HLSL grammar can be found in the online reference I've got a few questions about the tokens to be used.<br><br>Especially, I couldn't figure out how T_TYPE_ID and T_NON_TYPE_ID should be defined..
